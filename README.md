## 🚀 About Me

I'm a CS student passionate about **systems programming**, **data structures & algorithms**, and building things from the ground up. I believe in understanding the bigger picture and first principles rather than just memorizing patterns.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: **Network protocols (TCP/IP)**, **Server implementation**, **Compiler design**
- 🌱 Learning: **Low-level systems programming in C++**, **Memory optimization**, **Algorithm design**
- 💡 Philosophy: Understand concepts deeply to avoid edge cases
- 🧩 Daily practice: **LeetCode** challenges and hands-on coding projects

## 🌟 Fun Facts

- 🧠 I prefer recursive thinking first, then use explicit stacks as alternatives
- 🎯 I tackle problems by building intuition rather than memorizing solutions
- 🛠️ I love building projects from scratch to truly understand how things work
- 📚 Active learner using AI assistants for deep concept clarification
